Then, if you're on Windows, go to file explorer and find the ZIP file. (If you're not on Windows, google "how to extract a ZIP file on `your operating system here`") 

Then right click on the downloaded file (the ZIP file) and click on `Extract All...`. Next, do what it says and wait for it to finish extracting. You'll see a new folder after it finishes.

(it is usually at the bottom left or the top right)

Then, click on `Load Unpacked` and choose the folder you have extracted from the ZIP a few steps ago.
